This repository contains the full analysis pipeline for the project Quantifying Biomechanical Differences Between Professional and High School Runners Using Computer Pose Estimation. It includes two core Python scripts: extract_landmarks.py, which processes raw sprinting videos using MediaPipe to extract 3D body landmarks and compute frame-level features such as terminal swing indicators, and compute_metrics.py, which calculates all kinematic metrics used in the study (hip flexion, knee flexion, dorsiflexion, arm swing amplitude, overstriding, asymmetry, and upper-body rotation), performs statistical comparisons between demographic groups, and generates violin-plot visualizations. Video data is not included due to privacy considerations. The code is provided to ensure full methodological transparency and to support reproducibility for future biomechanical or sports-science research.
